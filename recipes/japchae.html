    Japchae (or chapchae) is a classic Korean dish of stir-fried dangmyeon (sweet potato glass noodles) mixed with colorful vegetables and often savory, marinated beef, all tossed in a sweet-savory soy and sesame dressing.<br> 
    Known for its appealing mix of textures and vibrant colors, japchae is a festive and celebratory dish often served on holidays and special occasions, though it's also a popular side dish year-round.
