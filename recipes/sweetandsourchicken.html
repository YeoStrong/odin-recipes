    Sweet and sour chicken is a Chinese-American takeout dish made of bite-sized, battered, and deep-fried chicken pieces coated in a vibrant sweet and sour sauce with vegetables and pineapple.<br>
    The characteristic tangy and sweet sauce is typically made from ingredients like vinegar, sugar, ketchup, and pineapple juice, while the crispy chicken provides a satisfying textural contrast.

  <ul>
    <li>For the sauce: water, pineapple juice from a can, white sugar, white vinegar, and orange food coloring</li>
    <li>For the batter: cornstarch, self-rising flour, vegetable oil, an egg, salt, and white pepper</li>
    <li>Chicken: Cut eight boneless, skinless chicken breast halves into 1-inch cubes for this sweet and sour chicken recipe. </li>
    <li>Pineapple and green pepper: Pineapple chunks and two green bell peppers (cut into 1-inch pieces) give the dish color and flavor. </li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine 1 Â½ cups of water, reserved pineapple juice, sugar, vinegar, and orange food coloring in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat; set aside.</li>
    <li>Mix 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup water together in a small bowl until smooth; pour into the sauce, stirring continuously, until slightly thickened.</li>
